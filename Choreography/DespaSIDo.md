# DespaSIDo

A reggaeton-style cooldown and stretch track

## Moves

* A sort of crab walk, diagonal step then feet together, knees bent, arms swing loosely out and back in. Twice to the right, twice to the left
* Side lunge (face forward, one leg bent, the other straight) , hold for 8 or 16
* Shoulder stretch (one arm across chest, the other crossing it at shoulder height, gently pulling it in and across)
* Tricep stretch (one elbow bent and behind head with hand down back, the other hand gently pulling the elbow down and across)
* Hamstring and calf stretch (sit back with one knee bent, the other leg stretched forward, foot flexed. Shift weight forward so front knee is bent, back leg is stretched. Do other side)

## Outline

This basically goes on in blocks of 16 count until arbitrarily stopping. Alternate the stretches above, with blocks of crab walk steps, as the music suggests. Doesn't have to line up completely. Try to time it for a freestyle bit at the end, people can let go.
