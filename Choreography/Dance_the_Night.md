# Dance The Night

A relaxed dance track to use after a workout track, with simplified choreography adapted from the popular film version

Borrowed moves

* Turn L, circle arm at shoulder twice (option to keep arm bent), repeat R
* As above but arm swing up and down (forwards), turn face on and move arms in heart shape, twice
* Dab-type move with one palm pressed to cheek, the other extended at shoulder height, twice both sides
* Arms parallel, palms inwards, swing diagonally, upper R to lower L, up and down twice and and repeat other side
* Sort of lurching moonwalk - shoulder rolls forward as back leg steps forward, rolls backwards as front leg slides to heel and toe in line
* Speedball, e.g. arms up and roll forearms over one another, L-R, high to low
