# Dance The Night

A relaxed dance track to use after a workout track, with simplified choreography adapted from the popular film version

Borrowed moves to potentially use:

* Turn L, circle arm at shoulder twice (option to keep arm bent), repeat R
* As above but arm swing up and down (forwards), turn face on and move arms in heart shape, twice
* Dab-type move with one palm pressed to cheek, the other extended at shoulder height, twice both sides
* Arms parallel, palms inwards, swing diagonally, upper R to lower L, up and down twice and and repeat other side
* Sort of lurching moonwalk - shoulder rolls forward as back leg steps forward, rolls backwards as front leg slides to heel and toe in line. Wrists flex down as arms come up, up as arms come down to waist height
* Speedball, e.g. arms up and roll forearms over one another, L-R, high to low
