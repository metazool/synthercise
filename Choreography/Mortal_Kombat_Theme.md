# Mortal Kombat theme

A pulse-raising track to use in the second half. Builds on some of the moves from the starting tracks.

## Moves

* (Like the warmup move of "Extend one arm to side, shoulder height, palm out, other hand on hip. Rotate waist, arm straight ahead. Alternate sides") - Extend one arm to side, chest height and sweep across. Hand movement can be horizontal like a strike or vertical like a blow, however people feel. Other arm elbow bent, palm above forehead as if to block face. 
* Diagonal heel dig, then toe back, option of bounce
* Option for heel dig of low kick, forward and back, bounce on other foot (be sure to show them all)
* Chopping movement with both hands, swinging from elbows. Face diagonally, low then high, repeat same side x4 (16 count) then other side
* Arm movement like Pinan Godan kata - one palm blocking just above forehead, other extended to side at 90 degrees, switch sides
