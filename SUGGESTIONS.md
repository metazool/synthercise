## Draft tracks

### Timber (Pitbull ft Ke$ha) [TBD] 
Already have some choreography for this and would like to keep it if possible

### Dynamite (BTS) [TBD]
Something relatively modern and familiar which serves as a pulse-raiser, more pop than banging

### Mortal Kombat theme [could replace]
Something crowd pleasing with a heavy beat for a proper cardio track (with a recovery afterwards). Not wedded to this and could replace

### You Should Be Dancing (Bee Gees) 
Already have some choreography for this and would like to keep it if possible

### I Don't Like It, I Love It 
Something relatively relaxed and downtempo to start warming down with - can't find contact details for the version on Spotify etc

### Harder, Better, Stronger, Faster [TBD]
Something repetitive and not too exciting but with a bit of groove to it, used mostly as a backdrop to stretches
