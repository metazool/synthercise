# Get ready to Synthercise!

Synthercise is an 8-bit dance fitness programme developed for Electromagnetic Field.

It's a 40-45 minute chiptune dance fitness workout approachable for beginners, with options for experienced exercisers - you don't have to think of yourself as fit, or a dancer, to enjoy Synthercise!


## Tracks - Unit 1

This set has a focus heavy on high-energy 90s numbers. The choice is driven by work I could find that's not DRM-encumbered. MP3s of most of the retro tracks were provided by the lovely [Raxlen Slice](https://www.youtube.com/c/RaxlenSlice), the rest are plundered from the [music archives of demozoo](https://demozoo.org/music/)
