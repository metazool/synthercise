# Synthercise Unplugged - Tech Neck 

## Overview

Bending our heads over a keyboard or phone screen leaves us with a case of "tech neck",

This set of posture and stretch exercises are derived from pilates / qi gong / yoga to relax the muscles in the neck and shoulders and ideally build a bit of support between the core and the mid-lower back.

There isn't a soundtrack for this, though something might help with the timing! 

_This is an initial draft and i'll extend or correct it with any good tips gleaned from other instructors_

## Breathing tips

* Breathe in through the nose, out through the nose
* To the extent possible, press the middle of your tongue against the upper palate, with the tongue tip resting below the upper front teeth (for relaxing) or below the lower front teeth (for fighting)
* Breathe in through the belly (Level 1)
* Breathe in through the side of the belly up to the sides of the ribs (Level 2)
* Breathe up from the side through the back, out through the top of the head (Level 3) 

## Exercises

### Standing

| Targets | Description | Repeats | Coaching points |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| Spine, core | Just stand there, arms at sides, feet hip-width apart. Draw lower back and belly muscles in towards your navel, aka "engage your core" | | Test hip-width apart by jumping a little in the air, see where feet naturally land. There's a string pulling up the crown of your head; your jawline pulls back and angles slightly upwards. Breathe |
| Shoulders, upper back | Raise your shoulders upwards towards your ears, then roll them backwards, bringing the shoulderblades together | x3 | Shoulderblades extend further down the back than you'd think |
| Neck, upper traps | Pull your left ear down towards your shoulder. After a few seconds, extend the left arm, fold at elbow, very gently press down against right ear. Breathe, return to centre, repeat other side|| | 
| Neck | Tuck your chin forwards, and slowly roll your head clockwise in a circle, then anticlockwise| 3x per direction| |
| Shoulders, wrists | Extend arms outwards, just below shoulder height, palms facing downwards. Rotate _just the wrists_, not the forearms, to face upwards | x3 ||
| Shoulders, wrists | Extend arms forwards, just below shoulder height, palms facing inwards and downwards. Flex _just the wrists_, to face forwards and outwards | x3 ||
| Shoulders, upper-mid back| From here (palms facing up) bend elbows so hands sit on shoulders. Roll elbows outwards, down and backwards, bringing them together in front of the chest. Repeat, then rotate in the opposite direction | x3 per direction| Encouraged to bend upper-mid back backwards as elbows rotate back, hunch slightly as elbows come forward|
| Shoulders, upper-mid back| Extend arms out to side, palms forwards, thumbs face upwards. Rotate wrists so thumbs face downwards. Push backwards and pulse three times, return to centre | x3| |

### Floor-based 

TBD more detail. Use a yoga mat for these ideally, and if your knees are trashed like mine are, fold part of the mat in half or even thirds to support them

* Find neutral spine from tabletop position, very slight angle of pelvis upwards and downwards until it settles neutral
* Cat-cow (arching back concave and then convex, eye gaze up or down, led from the pelvic angle)
* Camel (kneeling upright, support lower back with hands, bend backwards)
* Glute bridge (the camel antidote, lying on back) Heels below hips, raise core upwards until it's straight (not a back bend). Squeeze, hold for as long as possible. Slowly return to the ground, starting at the top, vertebra by vertebra
* Child pose (kneeling wide, bend forward at lower back, stretch arms forward, sink into it)

### Weights-based

TBD more detail. Back-strengthening exercises that help connect the neck to the core. Ideally use a weighted bar for this but who has one at home, i don't!

* Starting position is slightly wider than hip width, weight in the heels
* Partial deadlift (hip hinge backwards, lower bar to knees, summon glutes to raise back up, bar close against the front of the thighs)
* Rows (start the deadlift, stay at the bottom, pull the elbows back to move the weight upwards, keep them pressed close to the side of the body)
* Upright rows (from starting position, pull bar upwards, elbows are just below chest height. bar is just below nipple height, then return to start)
* Any sequence combining the above
